# ctx – Simple and Flexible Time Tracking

**ctx** is a time tracking tool for people who enjoy working in the terminal — and also for those who, inexplicably, prefer clicking around in a browser. It’s fast, scriptable, accessible, and easy to integrate with various workflows.

I built a full web UI too, for people who "don’t like typing." Whatever works.

## Features

- **CLI-first** – Ideal for terminal users who just want to `ctx switch "new task"` and get on with their day.
- **Web UI** – Built in React. Has buttons. Even looks kind of nice.
- **Workflow integration** – Easily plugs into shell environments and custom setups.
- **Win is not supported**

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go
- **Frontend**: React

---

## Installation

> Work in progress – installation instructions coming soon.

## Documentation

```
ctx help (for now)
```

## Quick start
```
ctx adm init
ctx sw "new task"
ctx serve //ui localhost:8080
```

## Why?

This whole thing started as an excuse to mess around with **Go** and **React**.  
That’s it. No grand vision. Just wanted to build something fun.  
And somewhere along the way it accidentally became useful.

## Goals

- Make time tracking as painless as possible.
- Offer both CLI and UI without making either feel second-class.
- Keep things fast, portable, and hackable.
- Learn some stuff. Break some things. Maybe help a few people.
